            <h2 style="color:yellow">Introduction</h2>
            Software engineering is a discipline that involves the application of scientific and engineering principles, problem-solving and 
            analytical skills by writing code to develop software for multiple platforms. Our programme structure encourages creativity, uses 
            current industry software tools and teaches the latest techniques in software development, testing, deployment and project 
            management as well as quality management.

            <h2 style="color:yellow">Requirements</h2>
            A pass in Matriculation or Foundation studies or equivalent with minimum CGPA of 2.00 or a pass in STPM or equivalent with a 
            minimum Grade C (GP 2.00) in any 2 subjects and credits in the following subjects at SPM level or its equivalent:</br>
            . Additional Mathematics; or</br>
            . Mathematics and one of the Science, Technology or Engineering related subject.</br>
            Note: Candidates for category from the last criteria as initially mentioned must take mathematics strengthening subject with topics 
            that are appropriate to the field of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the beginning of their study.</br>
            Students are required to pass the Mathematics strengthening subject as a prerequisite before being allowed to take the relevant 
            core courses. However, this does not prevent students from pursuing other core or non-core courses which do not set the mathematics 
            strengthening subject as a prerequisite. The requirement for Mathematics strengthening subject can be exempted if the Matriculation 
            programme, Foundation studies or equivalent has offered mathematics subject and their achievements are equivalent or more than the 
            credit requirements of the Additional Mathematics at SPM level; OR</br>
            . A pass in STPM Science stream or equivalent with a minimum Grade C (GP 2.00) in one Mathematics subject and one Science/ICT subject; OR</br>
            . A Diploma in Computer Science / Software Engineering / Information Technology / Information Systems or equivalent with a minimum 
              CGPA of 2.50; OR</br>
            . Any other Diploma in science and technology with a minimum CGPA of 2.50.</br>

            Note: Candidates for categories iii and iv with a CGPA between 2.00 and 2.50 may be admitted subject to a rigorous internal 
            assessment process of the HEP.
